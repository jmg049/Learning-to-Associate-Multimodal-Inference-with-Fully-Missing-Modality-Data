\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we propose \textbf{Cross-Modal Association Models (C-MAMs)}, a novel approach for handling missing modalities during inference in multimodal learning. 
Unlike existing methods that modify the training process, C-MAMs generate missing modality features \textbf{post-training}, preserving the integrity of the original multimodal model. 
In this paper, we: \textbf{(i)} formalise the problem of missing modality inference and its challenges, \textbf{(ii)} introduce C-MAMs as a flexible, lightweight, post-hoc solution for reconstructing missing modality embeddings, \textbf{(iii)} evaluate their effectiveness across diverse datasets, tasks, and baseline models, and \textbf{(iv)} analyze the quality of the generated versus the ground-truth features to quantify the reconstruction fidelity. 
Experimental results show that C-MAMs \textbf{significantly mitigate performance degradation} due to missing modalities, in some cases fully restoring baseline performance, even when \textbf{trained on 10\%} of the data. 
We conclude that post-training feature reconstruction is an effective, targeted alternative to existing methods, with broad applicability in multimodal systems.
